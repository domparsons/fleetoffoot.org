        <p>We operate out of the Hart Leisure Centre in Hitches Lane.</p>
        <p>
          We play exclusively outdoors on 3G surfaces, using either the 5 aside cages
          or areas of the full size pitch.
        </p>
        <p>Sessions are every week as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tuesday, 2pm start. Normally on the main pitch.</li>
          <li>Thursday, 2pm start. Usually in one of the cages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sessions are mostly men, but ladies can play.</p>

      <PageSection title="On Field Activities">
        <p>
          Playing is centred around the above sessions, which begin with a warm-up
          followed by typically 5 or 6 aside games in 10 minute sections with 2
          minutes rest in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          We play in accordance with the rules of the Walking Football Association,
          modified only by adherence to Hampshire FA's adoption of a 3 touch rule.

      <PageSection title="Club History and Organisation">
        <p>
          We first started playing in 2017, coinciding with the opening of Fleet's new
          leisure centre. With membership numbers growing at a steady rate, we were
          soon able to assume formal club status.
        </p>
        <p>The Club is affiliated to both the Walking Football Association and Hampshire FA.</p>
